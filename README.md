## Some verses to test
Falling stars and midnight skies,<br>
You whispered truth behind the lies.<br>
The silence screamed when you let go,<br>
Now I dance with your shadow.

___

City lights flicker on my skin,<br>
Running wild where dreams begin.<br>
Radio static, a voice unknown,<br>
I built my world with broken tones.

___

Wake me up with your neon glow,<br>
Heartbeat syncing to the show.<br>
Every step we take, electric fire,<br>
You're the spark, my one desire.
